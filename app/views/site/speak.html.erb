        <h2>Speak at Test Ruby PDX</h2>
        <p>Each month, Test Ruby PDX presents one or two talks ranging in length from
        20 minutes to 1 hour. If you would like to speak about an issue related to Ruby
        testing, we'd love to hear what you have to say! On this page you'll find
        all the information you need to create and submit an awesome talk.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>Here are the questions we hear the most often from prospective speakers. If
          you have another one, feel free to <a href='/contact'>contact us</a>!
        </p>
        <h4>What perspectives are you looking for?</h4>
        <p>Test Ruby PDX exists to promote Ruby testing in all its forms. Different things
          work for different people and different projects, and reasonable people can 
          disagree. That's why we encourage you to submit any testing-related talk. If
          we think it needs tweaking, we'll let you know!</p>
        <p>The most important qualification here is that talks should, in general, be geared
          toward developers and not project managers or QA/QE professionals (who have their own
          meetups). Test Ruby PDX exists to foster interest and involvement in testing on the 
          part of programmers, so that's who your target audience should be.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, please submit! We won't bite and might even give suggestions as to
          how to improve your proposal to be more on-point for our attendees.</p>
        <h4>How long should my talk be?</h4>
        <p>Talks can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour in length. We encourage you to
          include Q & A with your talk. At this point, we don't do lightning talks.
        </p>
        <h4>What topics should I cover?</h4>
        <p>We are very open to suggestions, but if you're looking for inspiration, check
          out <a href='#suggested_topics'>our list of suggested topics</a>, below.

        <h2>Suggested Topics</h2>
        <p>We encourage you to submit talks on any subject related to Ruby testing and 
          project management approaches. This section is only to pique your imagination, not
          to imply talks on other topics will not be accepted. (In designing your proposal, 
          please remember that your audience will be primarily Ruby developers, not project managers or QA professionals.)</p>
